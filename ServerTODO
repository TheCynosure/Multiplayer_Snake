Fixing the Server
1. Use a single UDP Port to handle all traffic and instead record the address and port of each of the clients that contact the server.
2. Rewrite UDP_Comm to be a simple way to message the server from the clients
3. Make it so the server waits for data from all parties before pushing out new data.
4. Make the game server decide the timing on all the computers.
  ^ Do this using a similiar refresh method to the snake game.
